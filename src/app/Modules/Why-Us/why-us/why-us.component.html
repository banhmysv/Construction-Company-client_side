            <p>Construction projects are exposed to risks at the time of their coming into existence. During various stages,
              it must first of all be considered what risks the project manager would like to counter with measures and how
              costly these measures are. In this situation, our risk managers can provide valuable advice to our customers
              and project managers.</p>
